There are not a lot of documentation (specially technical documentation). We found some in the assignment web site and a little bit more in the web of the proyect. In both places we only found some descriptions about the features and the scope of the plugin. We used this documentation to understand the principal target of the plugin. On the other and we found a figure of the architecture of the pluging and how it is embeded in eclipse.
