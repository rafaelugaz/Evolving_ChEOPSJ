====================
Exceptional Entities
====================
The AbstractEntityRecorder Hierarchy seems suspicious (very broad 2nd depth level) and is most likely the one we should refactor to make
the adding of new recorders easier. 
Some sibling classes of this hierarchy are larger than their super class which could imply that too little is inherited form the super class. Must verify this via coe browsing

The Subject Hierarchy seems more "correct"

No classes seem too exceptional in their sizes, only perhaps ModelManager which is also labeled as a God Class by the Infusion tool.
ClassRecorder is also a God Class according to Infusion, we should look further into that.

====================
Tests
====================
We should create black box tests (test the interface not the implementation) and use them as regression tests for the two subsystems that we will modify:
ModelManager and the ChangeRecorder hierarchy

Tests to understand?

Regression Test AFTER EVERY CHANGE

====================
Migrate Systems Incrementally
====================
Choose one part to tackle at a time
Build tests for that part
====================
Prototype the target solution
====================
We can create a branch of the repository in github and use it as a "throwaway" prototype
