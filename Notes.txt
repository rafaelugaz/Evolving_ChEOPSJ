Checklist:
• Abstract classes and methods reveal design intentions.
• Classes high in the hierarchy often define domain abstractions; their subclasses introduce variations on a theme.
• Occurrences of the Singleton [p. 321] pattern may represent information that is constant for the entire execution of a system.
• Surprisingly large structures often specify important chunks of functionality.
• Comments reveal a lot about the design intentions behind a particular piece of code, yet may often be misleading.

Findings per project:
=====================
/be.ac.ua.ansymo.cheopsj
Only contains feature.xml with references to all other projects. 
Also contains update site url. Apparently is for finding and installing the plugin.

/be.ac.ua.ansymo.cheopsj.branding
Contains a manifest and about.html website. Maybe for the plugin page.

/be.ac.ua.ansymo.cheopsj.changerecorders
	Datastructures for storing the changes of each type of entity (Class, Method, Variable, etc)
	AbstractEntityRecorder at TOP of hierarchy subclassed by all recorders.
	StatementRecorder also abstract subclassed only by LocalVariable and MethodInvocation recorders adds extra common methods
	One class recorder for each type of change (e.g. field, method, package, etc)
	Store change method used by all and they also implement the createAndLinkFamixElement and createAndLinkChange methods.
	FOR OUR PROJECT GOAL: We would need to extend/create some recorders e.g. local variables, method signature, accessors, etc.
	Note: Some of this classes are already in the project but have been excluded form the build path (probably incomplete) so we can maybe use
	them as basis.
	Comments: Decent amount of comments in the most important classes and methods, the functionality of these classes is also not very complicated.
	
/be.ac.ua.ansymo.cheopsj.distiller
	This whole project implements the functionality of CHEOPSJ to extract the changes from an existing java project by
	connecting to a SVN repository and "distilling" the changes stored there by means of an external library called ChangeDistiller from the
	Evolizer platform.

	- distiller.cd
		ChangeDistillerProxy uses the API of the ChangeDistiller to extract the source code changes from two java files
	- distiller.popup.actions
		Implements the actions taken when the user selects "Distill Changes" and "Distill Additions" from the popup menu
	- distiller.svnconnection
		Takes care of connecting and extracting the revisions from the SVN repository.
		The SVN url is currently hardcoded and this could cause problems.
	
/be.ac.ua.ansymo.cheopsj.logger
	The class Cheops when the plugin is started creates new listeners.JavaElementChange class which is used as a listener for the changes that has
	been made.

	- logger.astdiffer
		The class ASTComparator is used in the ChangeRecorder class in the method findAndLogChanges and in class DistillChanges in order to
		compare the old and new AST and to find the differences by using the method diff.
		The DiffVisitor class extends ASTVisitor which is used to visit every node in an Abstract Syntax Tree. This class is instanciated in
		the ASTComparator class in order to compare the differencies between the two ASTs.
	- logger.listeners
		The class JavaElementChange creates new IElementChangedListener which is used when a new Cheops is created and serves as a listener
		if any changes are made to a Java element. It records the fine grained changes using the method recordElementChanges().
		The method recordElementChanges in the class ChangeRecorder is used by JavaElementChange in order to record the changes made
		inside the Java editor.

/be.ac.ua.ansymo.cheopsj.model
	Famix?, Changes model, Model manager
	
	- model.changes
		The class Change implements the interface IChange. This class only implements the methods from the interface and is extended by 
		AtomicChange and CompositeChange classes.
	- model.famix

/be.ac.ua.ansymo.cheopsj.model.ui
	UI model
/be.ac.ua.ansymo.cheopsj.testtool
	Testing
	
/be.ac.ua.ansymo.cheopsj.update
	
/org.evolizer.changedistiller
Seems to contain some static constants to represent types of changes.
Source is missing though.
